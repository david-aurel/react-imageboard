# React Imageboard

Welcome to my Image Board ðŸ˜Š

The easiest way to check it out is to visit the page live at [react-imageboard.firebaseapp.com](https://react-imageboard-firebaseapp.com). Or, to get a dev environment going, clone this repo, install node modules with `npm i` and fire it up using `npm run start` or `yarn start`ðŸ¤–

## Description

A place to enjoy beautiful images of all sorts. The webpage fetches images from the unsplash api and displays them in a grid. Users can browse, search for topics, and control display settings.

## Features

-   Browse pictures from the unsplash api in a responsive, multi size grid: The key player here is the `grid-auto-flow: dense` property and setting `object-fit: cover`. Here's a tutorial explaining the `dense` property in more detail: [css-tricks.com/...](https://css-tricks.com/the-auto-flowing-powers-of-grids-dense-keyword/)

-   Search for topics: A `GET` Request to the unsplash api using the input value is made.

*   Customize the grid: Using root variables in the style sheet, values for grid rows, columns and gap sizes can be changed dynamically. Or toggle a `big` class on the most popular 10% of images!

-   Browse it on mobile: Designed mobile first, this page does very well on all view sizes. One CSS breakpoint at `415px` is used to transition from mobile to desktop.

-   Browse by keyboard: Use the `tab`, `Shift + Tab`, `Space`, and `Enter` keys to navigate all parts of the page without hassle. Furthermore, all UI elements are high in contrast and easy to read.

*   Scroll infinitely: Upon scrolling to the bottom, the page will automatically load more images. Currently, the unsplash api allows for 50 requests per hour.

-   See error information: Get a display of the error message if something went wrong, while images are loading or your search didn't return any results.

## The biggest struggle?

Even though a library could've gotten me much better results, I'm pretty happy with the CSS grid I made. However, there is no way to keep the images fully uncropped, without having to do some heavy calculations and translations.

## The biggest success?

The search functionality ðŸ˜‹ It's so satisfying to browse topics that come to mind and scroll through beautiful images. If I had more time, I'd implement a feature to create collections and moodboards to save the favorite images you come across.

## Final Thoughts

This was fun. I had an absolute blast making it and look forward to take it to the next level in the next coming weeks ðŸ¤—
